# Counter Strike : Source Custom HUD + Models
This set of custom files will modify the appearance of the HUD, and some models for CS:S, it has been made mostly for Trikz, and some stuff will surely be scuffed !

## Installation
To install it, you just have to create a folder at this path : 

`Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike\custom\`

All you have left to do is dropping all the folders inside it after extraction.

In case you change something, you will have to restart the game to see the modifications take place !

## Customization
If you want to modify stuff, you should refer to https://github.com/teleqwe/CSSHudDocumentation, it's the documentation I personally used.

## Examples
Here's a few screenshots to give you an idea of the result :
